Hi. I'm a bootstrap starter theme called Educational Theme, if you like. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.
Getting Started
•	If you want to keep it simple, head over to https://www.lyrathemes.com/bootstrap-wordpress-theme-tutorial-1/ and follow the step by step procedure to develop a responsive bootstrapper WordPress theme. 
•	After following all the steps, you will be able to create all the php files like (style.php, header.php, footer.php, functions.php, index.php, sidebar.php) required for the bootstrapper WordPress theme. Once you have all the files in your server, you can make the changes according to your template requirements. 
•	We have made some changes in the following pages functions.php, header.php, index.php and footer.php to meet the requirements. You can also make some changes in this bootstrapper WordPress theme template according to your requirements. 

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Good luck!
